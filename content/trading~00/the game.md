> Read this before you touch any other note in the vault.

## 1. The Illusion of Profits
Most people start trading because they see others getting rich from it. They want to get rich fast. But trading is a **zero-sum game** — for every winner, there's a loser.  
📉 **90-90-90 Rule**: 90% of traders lose 90% of their money in the first 90 days.

---

## 2. What Do You Trade?
You can trade: 
- [[Equities]]
- [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]]
- [[Commodities]]
- [[Indices]]

If you trade:
- **Stocks** → Understand [[Earnings & Reports]], use screeners.
- **Forex** → Learn [[Interest Rates]], [[Inflation]], [[Geopolitical Risk]], [[Central Banks]].
- **Crypto** → (Subjective) Driven mostly by sentiment. Proceed with caution.
- Derivatives → Learn [[Options Greeks]] [[IV Crush]] [[Straddle]] [[Theta Decay]].

---

## 3. Leverage & Lot Sizes
Understand:
- [[Leverage vs Effective Leverage]]
- [[Lot Sizes]]
- [[Margin]]
- [[Risk Management]]

Example: XAU/USD dipped 13% in a day once. Know that before using leverage. Don't let leverage become a death sentence. so a 1:8 Effective leverage will be good considering you have extra liquidity on the side incase of a margin call.

---

## 4. Strategy
You need one. No strategy = you *are* the liquidity.  
Popular ideas:
- [[Support & Resistance]]
- [[Order Blocks]]
- [[Inner Circle Trader (ICT)]]
- [[FVG & IFVG]]
- [[SMT]]
- [[FIB Retracement]]
- [[Price Action]]

Alpha decays. You need to adapt.

## 5. Win Rate & RR
At RR 1:2, even **35% win rate = profitable**.  
RR 1:10 = break even at 9.2%.  
→ Use [[Risk Management]], track your Win Rate, keep logs.

---

## 6. Discipline
50% strategy, 50% discipline.  
Limit:
- 2 trades per asset/day  
- 5 trades total/day  

Avoid:
- Revenge trading  
- Overconfidence  
- Overtrading  
Set SL/TP and walk away. [[Trader Psychology]] is not optional.

---

## 7. Paper Trading
Practice for 4 months minimum.
- Learn Stop Loss, Take Profit, [[Points and Pips]], [[Slippage]], Ticks
- Observe FOMC or [[Earnings & Reports]]
- Avoid trading the news unless you *really* know what you're doing

---

## 8. Stop Loss
Your first and most important layer of [[Risk Management]].  
Set one **every time**. No exceptions. TP is optional. SL is not.

---

## 9. Futures & Options
Primarily tools for [[Hedging]].  
If you don’t know:
- [[Rolling]]
- [[IV Crush]]
- [[Theta Decay]]
- [[Options Greeks]]
→ Then you’re not ready.

Prefer Options > Futures due to flexibility and reduced obligation.  
Also, expect:

- Avoid FOMO, learn to wait for clean entries

---

## 10. Risk Management
Risk **0.5–1.0% per trade**.  
Once in profit:

Track:
