**Dear Mr. Rahul Gandhi,**

**History and Legacy**
	- India
	- Congress / Indian National Congress
**Background**
India's democracy is on a dangerous path and it's on the verge of collapsing, if nothing is done on an immediate basis and in a concrete manner. As a responsible citizen of India, like yourself, I am of the strong view that the onus of resurrecting the Indian Democracy lies on every citizen, including me. In this time of critical juncture in India's past, present and future, it's high time we come together and formulate a formidable strategy, and put it in action.
