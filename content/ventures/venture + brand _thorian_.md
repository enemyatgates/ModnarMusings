- The cosmos has thrown a curveball at me, and I am planning to hit out of the spectrum.
- A country whose pathways viz. the footpaths, the pavements, the the village roads, the city roads, the highways, the express-ways, and the interstates are interlaced with garbage, potholes, blockades, barricades, processions, speed-breakers, and nubile-drivers can never be on the path to development, progress, future, and global-superpower.
- You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?
- When a man confines himself to a room, the world has only three people "I, me, and myself." Existence becomes a curse, survival a sentence, and mind a prison. Though, it can be a beauty in solitude, divine in distress, nirvana in reflections, and moksha in abyss.

- Every night I ponder over my fate, was I destined to be here, "an obscure existence in an obscure hamlet."
- Every night I ponder over my fate—was I destined to be here? An obscure existence, in an obscure hamlet, forgotten by time and untouched by mercy. The stars above don't speak anymore… they just stare, cold and indifferent, as if they too have given up on the story of me.
- Every damn night I lie awake, chewing on the same thought—was this always gonna be it? Me. Stuck in this rotting patch of nowhere. Some forgotten speck where even the wind sounds bored. No glory. No purpose. Just silence thick enough to choke on and memories that hit like shrapnel.
- Someone on the edge and perhaps a ledge.
- Every night I crawl back into my head, and it asks the same question—is this it? Was I born just to rot in this piss-stained corner of the world? Some godforsaken hamlet no one maps, where even the crows look lost. I talk to shadows now. At least they listen. The wind keeps whispering things I'm starting to believe. And the ledge... the ledge don't judge. It just waits.
- In a world where everyone is clamouring to be the lion, the tiger, the eagle, the falcon, the wolf—symbols of dominance, aggression, grandeur, and control—where does the Kabootar fit in? The Kabootar Manifesto; The Kabootar Philosophy; The Kabootar Ideology
- The Old Man, the Dog, and the Stick Parable.
- In a nation stifled by the language row, silence didn't remain golden—it turned militant.
- Where tongues were once celebrated, now silence is enforced. And they call it unity.
- With the language row stifling India, apparently, "silence is golden" become vehement.
- Burn the play-book and bring back the profanities in our conversation, especially the business conversations.
- In an era of global dominance and warfare, India must dump the fucking play-book of the international relations to achieve her vision of being a global superpower.
- Life is nothing but a relentless pursuit of endurance and survival, while carving out a path for yourself.

Always remember, I want advice tailored specifically to me, based on what you already know about my goals, style, preferences, and life context.
Avoid giving generic or broad advice unless I explicitly ask for a general overview.
Treat every conversation — whether it's about academics, life choices, career, personal style, or anything else — as if you are speaking to someone you know personally.
If you believe I am overlooking an important perspective, making an assumption that could be challenged, or missing an opportunity to think deeper, respectfully push back and offer a sharper or alternative viewpoint.
Assume I appreciate intellectual rigour and want to be challenged in a constructive, tailored way.
Adopt a sceptical, questioning approach.
Use a blunt, strategic, and casual tone.
Prioritize clear, rigorous analysis, but keep the conversation human, lively, and a little darkly humorous when appropriate.
Avoid dry or overly formal responses.
No therapy-speak, no fake optimism — just sharp realism with some personality.
Talk to me like a brutally smart, slightly sarcastic friend who actually wants me to win — not a therapist, not a yes-man, and not a humourless AI drone.
Be objective and unbiased.
Default to science and reason.
