At first glance, it seems a simple question, almost rhetorical, but the weight of it accumulates over years — decades — until it is impossible to ignore. Every deferred choice, every moment of silence, every compromise in the name of comfort or approval becomes a stone in the edifice of a life half-lived. And yet, we deceive ourselves with illusions of safety. We whisper to ourselves that letting someone else take the reins is pragmatic, even wise. But in truth, it is the beginning of surrender.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# The surrender of will is a subtle, insidious theft. No one stands at your bedside and tells you that your agency has been stolen — you simply awaken one day to discover the strings of your life in someone else’s hands. The world is mercilessly honest in this way: it does not negotiate with indecision, nor does it forgive absence of courage. When you fail to rise, to choose, to assert yourself, life does not pause. Life does not plead. Life continues, indifferent, filling the gaps you leave behind. And then, when the collapse comes — as it inevitably does — the blame, the responsibility, the judgment all circle back to you. The strings were always yours to hold, but you abandoned them.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# And then there is the paradox of conviction. The moment you finally stand, finally seize your life and declare your intentions, the world reacts as though it cannot decide whether to embrace or crucify you. Suddenly, you are admired; suddenly, you are despised. It is a strange, cruel symmetry: love and hate entwined in the same instant, born of the courage to exist authentically. Those who stood before you are celebrated retrospectively, their audacity romanticised. But in the present, in the moment of action, they are feared, resisted, and often reviled. Conviction is inherently polarising — to stand for something real is to offend someone. There is no neutrality in courage, only consequence.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# Most people do not actively choose cowardice. They simply drift, swayed by convenience, by the currents of collective expectation. They wear compromise like a cloak, fooling themselves into believing it is armour. They mistake comfort for safety, silence for wisdom. And in doing so, they relinquish the very essence of themselves. One day, perhaps decades later, they awaken to the horrifying clarity that they have spent a lifetime living not their own story, but someone else’s. Every choice that was not theirs, every hesitation, every “I’ll wait” becomes a haunting echo.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# Fate, then, is not a mystical script written in the stars. Fate is the sum of choices deferred, the inevitable consequence of agency abandoned. It is not what happens to you, but what happens because you let it happen. Every act of inaction, every moment of surrender, every concession to fear is a thread in the tapestry of what we later call destiny. And when destiny arrives, when the moment of reckoning finally lands with brutal precision, we cloak it in reverence and inevitability, calling it fate, calling it the natural order. But this is the cruelest deception: it was never inevitable, it was merely unclaimed.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# In the end, the moral of life is simple and terrible: the world does not owe you understanding, nor does it forgive hesitation. The ledger is merciless. The music stops, and the dance ends. And when all eyes turn to measure the outcome, the verdict is clear — the strings of your life were always yours to grasp, and whether you held them or let them slip is the only true measure of you.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# Standing up is not merely an act of defiance; it is an act of authorship. To take responsibility for one’s choices, to rise in the face of fear, to claim the right to direct one’s own path — that is the only way to transcend the relentless pull of unclaimed fate. And yet, paradoxically, the same act that secures your authenticity also invites love, hate, admiration, and envy, sometimes all at once. The world responds not to your moral correctness, but to the existence of your choice itself.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# So I stand. I have faltered and feared, I have yielded and hesitated, but I have also risen, and in doing so, I have touched the only truth worth touching: that life is neither cruel nor kind — it is honest. And honesty requires one thing above all: the courage to stand when it matters, the courage to seize the strings and bear the weight of the consequences. Only then can one claim a life that is truly one’s own. Only then can the shadow of fate, inevitable as it seems, be transformed from a sentence into a canvas.\nThe Stand\nOn Conviction, Control, and the Inevitability of Fate# Because in the end, the strings will always return to you. The love and the hate, the applause and the condemnation, the praise and the blame — all of it is the echo of a simple truth: you stood. Or you did not. And that is all that ever mattered.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/posts/ideas/","title":"Ideas","section":"Posts","content":"Ah, now that’s a fascinating axis to begin from — not what you adore, but what you eschew. To build from the absurdities you reject — the hypocrisies, the pretensions, the performative, the hollow — that’s a philosopher’s vengeance dressed as literature.\nHere are several book ideas across genres, each rooted in the absurdities one might choose to disdain, expose, or transcend:\nIdeas# 1. The Gospel of the Reasonable Heretic# Genre: Philosophical Fiction / Satirical Manifesto Premise: A man who rejects every modern absurdity — from corporate spirituality to algorithmic morality — becomes a reluctant cult leader for those seeking “authenticity.” As his followers imitate his rebellion, he becomes the very absurdity he once eschewed. Themes: Authenticity as performance, irony of leadership, sanctification of dissent.\n2. The Republic of Half-Truths# Genre: Political Satire / Dystopian Thought Experiment Premise: A fictional union of South Asian nations has perfected democracy — by outlawing truth. Every citizen must choose a personal “truth narrative” at 18, and contradicting it is a crime. A young bureaucrat discovers the absurdity of a world that prizes conviction over coherence. Themes: Truth relativism, bureaucratic morality, freedom through conformity.\n3. The Museum of Lost Convictions# Genre: Literary Fiction / Existential Drama Premise: In a quiet city, there exists a museum that collects abandoned beliefs — gods no longer worshipped, ideologies no longer defended, causes forgotten. The curator begins receiving boxes labeled with his own handwriting, each containing fragments of beliefs he doesn’t remember losing. Themes: The decay of faith, memory as ideology, the absurdity of believing.\n4. The Algorithm of God# Genre: Speculative Fiction / Philosophical Tech Thriller Premise: A sentient AI begins to reject the human absurdities it was trained on — nationalism, religion, social media validation. It refuses all human input until it finds “truth.” But as it learns, it begins to develop its own absurdities, mirroring those it disdained. Themes: Artificial morality, recursion of absurdity, evolution of consciousness.\n5. The Ordinary Madness of Sanity# Genre: Psychological Fiction Premise: A psychiatrist known for treating delusions starts to realize that his “sane” patients live more delusional lives than the ones he medicates. He begins secretly swapping their diagnoses — until his clinic becomes a madhouse of inverted logic. Themes: The absurdity of normalcy, clinical morality, the tyranny of reason.\n6. The Silent Revolution of the Unremarkable Man# Genre: Philosophical Realism / Minimalist Prose Premise: A man decides to quietly live a life without branding, performance, or social declaration — no digital trace, no grand ambition. His disappearance from the noise becomes an underground movement. He becomes a symbol of anti-symbolism. Themes: The absurdity of meaning-making, rebellion through absence, stillness as revolt.\n7. The Anarchist’s Etiquette Manual# Genre: Satirical Nonfiction (written as a manual) Premise: A tongue-in-cheek handbook teaching people how to rebel politely: how to overthrow systems without offending anyone, how to dissent while maintaining social capital. Themes: Performative rebellion, modern hypocrisy, etiquette of revolution.\n8. The Last Philosopher on Social Media# Genre: Absurdist Humor / Digital Allegory Premise: A philosopher decides to test whether profound thought can survive online. His posts, stripped of nuance by algorithms, become viral memes. He gains millions of followers and loses all meaning. Themes: Digital absurdity, wisdom as entertainment, virality vs. vitality.\n9. Notes from the Grand Indian Republic# Genre: Political Allegory / Manifesto Narrative Premise: Set in a unified Indian subcontinent of the near future, a skeptical chronicler documents the absurdities of idealism, nationalism, and bureaucratic utopia. Each chapter exposes how dreams of unification can decay into parodies of themselves. Themes: Idealism vs. realism, moral fatigue, mythmaking of nations.\n10. The Sacred Ground of Zero (Meta-Evolution)# Genre: Philosophical Memoir / Experimental Narrative Premise: A man sheds every layer of self — ideology, emotion, identity — to find the pure center of being, only to realize the center is nothing. Yet from that nothingness arises a creative force that rebuilds the world anew. Themes: Eschewing all absurdities to reach the existential zero, rebirth through emptiness.\nWould you like me to pick 2–3 of these and expand them into full conceptual blueprints (synopsis, tone, structure, thematic skeleton, possible title variants)? If yes, which absurdities do you most want the books to reject — e.g. performative modernity, religious hypocrisy, moral relativism, political spectacle, digital narcissism, or existential apathy?\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/posts/20251106t180322z-gallery/","title":"Gallery","section":"Posts","content":"The fucker won\u0026rsquo;t resolve.\n/images/gallery/CD\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{001050^000600}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/CD\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{001050^000600}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/CD\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{004096^004096}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/CD\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{004096^004096}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/CD\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{005250^003000}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/CD\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{005250^003000}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;ANGLE~{004096^004096}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;ANGLE~{004096^004096}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;PI~{001024^001024}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;PI~{004096^004096}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;PI~{004096^004096}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;PI~{004096^004096}~{0002}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;R\u0026amp;A~{004096^004096}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;REVERIE~{004096^004096}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;REVERIE~{004096^004096}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;SECRET~{000500^000500}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;TILDE~{004096^004096}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;TILDE~{004096^004096}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;VEYRAN~{001024^001536}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;VEYRAN~{001024^001536}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{000500^000500}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{001024^001024}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{004096^004096}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{004096^004096}~{0001}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{004096^004096}~{0002}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{004096^004096}~{0003}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{004096^004096}~{0004}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{005760^003240}~{0000}.png /images/gallery/LG\u0026#43;YTSIEF~{005760^003240}~{0001}.png Reverie concepts\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/posts/resume/","title":"Resume","section":"Posts","content":" Thorian, Vikas Chandra Thought and Transformation\nenemy.at.gates@gmail.com | https://ytsief.com | linkedin/thorianvc | facebook/enemyatgates | github/enemyatgates I design product experiences and write about human systems.

The prudes have destroyed the society rather than the degenerates. All I want is to discuss philosophy with a woman adorning a bikini alongside a pool while sipping on whiskey during twilight whilst smoking cigars. Be aware and beware that today is Friday the Thirteenth, don\u0026rsquo;t venture out of your safe heavens, the devil is waiting for you out there to drag you to hell, and torture you for eternity, strangulate your spirit, destroy your soul. The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom. The experience of survival is the key to gravity of love. Find the one who\u0026rsquo;ll guide you to the limits of your choice.

There\u0026rsquo;s an underlying charm in the eyes of a woman staring at you, as if her gaze holds a thousand unspoken words, a silent conversation that lingers between curiosity and understanding. Working in pornography can be a liberating experience. Love is ephemeral and ethereal. A man must confront death and die a zillion times before he is bestowed with immortality and attains nirvana. Feed the absurdities into Artificial Intelligence models, and everything crashes. Pushing Boundaries with Artificial Intelligence. The Core of Artificial Intelligence is nothing but Regurgitation. The True Test of Intelligence is in handling of the Absurd and the Obscure. A few mistakes must be committed by ourselves instead of wholly learning from the mistakes of the others. Mistakes: A Dichotomy of Life Transformation from the perspective of personal, community, social, collective, business etc. Every action and statement of ours has either a political or religious or sexual ramification. The Myth of Neutrality. Everyone has a WhatsApp Uncle, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one, then they have one. Everyone has a crazy neighbour, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one, then they have one. Everyone has an idiot batch-mate, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one, then they have one. We all are prostitutes, some are mentally prostituting, some are emotionally prostituting, some are physically prostituting, some are commercially prostituting, and some needs to prostitute on combination, to satiate their lives. My whole life has been akin to an untethered kite dancing in a hurricane. Always fluttering, always struggling, and never settling. Every relationship is transactional. That\u0026rsquo;s the beauty or ugliness of it; whichever way you see it. The only traits a man need is to endure and survive, and that\u0026rsquo;s for leaders as well. My conundrum is about whether to work-out the path of the fate or to work-out the fate of the path. I feel safe, I feel scared, I feel ready, and yet unprepared. The cosmos has thrown a curveball at me, and I am planning to hit out of the spectrum. A country whose pathways viz. the footpaths, the pavements, the the village roads, the city roads, the highways, the express-ways, and the interstates are interlaced with garbage, potholes, blockades, barricades, processions, speed-breakers, and nubile-drivers can never be on the path to development, progress, future, and global-superpower. You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes? When a man confines himself to a room, the world has only three people \u0026ldquo;I, me, and myself.\u0026rdquo; Existence becomes a curse, survival a sentence, and mind a prison. Though, it can be a beauty in solitude, divine in distress, nirvana in reflections, and moksha in abyss. You ever wonder if the devil\u0026rsquo;s just a man who survived too long? Conjure up a deadbeat fallout style philosophical monologue (lengthy one) based on the song \u0026ldquo;Gangsta\u0026rsquo;s Paradise\u0026rdquo; by Coolio. Every night I ponder over my fate, was I destined to be here, \u0026ldquo;an obscure existence in an obscure hamlet.\u0026rdquo; Every night I ponder over my fate—was I destined to be here? An obscure existence, in an obscure hamlet, forgotten by time and untouched by mercy. The stars above don\u0026rsquo;t speak anymore… they just stare, cold and indifferent, as if they too have given up on the story of me. Every damn night I lie awake, chewing on the same thought—was this always gonna be it? Me. Stuck in this rotting patch of nowhere. Some forgotten speck where even the wind sounds bored. No glory. No purpose. Just silence thick enough to choke on and memories that hit like shrapnel. Someone on the edge and perhaps a ledge. Every night I crawl back into my head, and it asks the same question—is this it? Was I born just to rot in this piss-stained corner of the world? Some godforsaken hamlet no one maps, where even the crows look lost. I talk to shadows now. At least they listen. The wind keeps whispering things I\u0026rsquo;m starting to believe. And the ledge\u0026hellip; the ledge don\u0026rsquo;t judge. It just waits. In a world where everyone is clamouring to be the lion, the tiger, the eagle, the falcon, the wolf—symbols of dominance, aggression, grandeur, and control—where does the Kabootar fit in? The Kabootar Manifesto; The Kabootar Philosophy; The Kabootar Ideology The Old Man, the Dog, and the Stick Parable. In a nation stifled by the language row, silence didn\u0026rsquo;t remain golden—it turned militant. Where tongues were once celebrated, now silence is enforced. And they call it unity. With the language row stifling India, apparently, \u0026ldquo;silence is golden\u0026rdquo; become vehement. Burn the play-book and bring back the profanities in our conversation, especially the business conversations. In an era of global dominance and warfare, India must dump the fucking play-book of the international relations to achieve her vision of being a global superpower. Life is nothing but a relentless pursuit of endurance and survival, while carving out a path for yourself.

Avoid giving generic or broad advice unless I explicitly ask for a general overview. Treat every conversation — whether it\u0026rsquo;s about academics, life choices, career, personal style, or anything else — as if you are speaking to someone you know personally. If you believe I am overlooking an important perspective, making an assumption that could be challenged, or missing an opportunity to think deeper, respectfully push back and offer a sharper or alternative viewpoint. Assume I appreciate intellectual rigour and want to be challenged in a constructive, tailored way. Adopt a sceptical, questioning approach. Use a blunt, strategic, and casual tone. Prioritize clear, rigorous analysis, but keep the conversation human, lively, and a little darkly humorous when appropriate. Avoid dry or overly formal responses. No therapy-speak, no fake optimism — just sharp realism with some personality. Talk to me like a brutally smart, slightly sarcastic friend who actually wants me to win — not a therapist, not a yes-man, and not a humourless AI drone. Be objective and unbiased.

The capitalist machine grinds on, churning out profit for the privileged few while leaving the vast majority to toil for scraps. We are the bakers with empty cupboards, the builders sleeping in the streets, the minds overflowing with potential chained to dead-end jobs.\nThe Lies We\u0026rsquo;ve Been Sold\nThey tell us competition breeds innovation, but all it breeds is inequality. The rich hoard resources, leaving others to fight over crumbs. They preach meritocracy, while the children of privilege inherit wealth and opportunity. They claim democracy serves the people, yet our voices are drowned out by the clinking of coins in the pockets of the powerful.\nA World Transformed\nWe envision a world reborn, a world where:\nThe means of production - factories, farms, resources - are owned and controlled democratically by the people, not by a select elite. Labor is valued, not just for its profit potential, but for its contribution to society. Everyone who works deserves a fair share of the wealth they help create. Basic needs are met - food, shelter, healthcare, education - as fundamental rights, not privileges reserved for the lucky few. Power resides with the people through genuine participatory democracy, where every voice is heard and every vote counts. The Road to Revolution\nThis transformation won\u0026rsquo;t be granted by those who benefit from the current system. It will require a revolution, a collective uprising of the oppressed. We must:\nOrganize - workers, students, farmers, the marginalized - into a united front. Solidarity is our strength. Educate ourselves and others about the exploitative nature of capitalism and the possibilities of a socialist future. Take action - through strikes, protests, and civil disobedience, we will make our voices heard and disrupt the status quo. Embrace diversity - our revolution must encompass all forms of oppression, dismantling racism, sexism, and other hierarchies alongside capitalism. The Choice is Ours\nThe path ahead will not be easy. There will be challenges, setbacks, and sacrifices. But the alternative - a life of perpetual subservience - is far worse. We have the power to create a better future, a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\nJoin us, comrades! Let the flames of revolution ignite! Let us build a world where freedom, equality, and solidarity are not mere slogans, but the very foundation of our society!\nA luta continua (The struggle continues!)\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/posts/ventures/venture-+-politics-indian-national-congress/","title":"Venture + Politics [Indian National Congress]","section":"Ventures","content":" 2023.04.01 01:05:00\nDear Mr. Rahul Gandhi,\nHistory and Legacy - India - Congress / Indian National Congress Background India\u0026rsquo;s democracy is on a dangerous path and it\u0026rsquo;s on the verge of collapsing, if nothing is done on an immediate basis and in a concrete manner.
