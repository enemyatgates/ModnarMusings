He didn’t speak. He just watched, eyes glimmering with that infuriating mix of knowing and indifference.
I broke the silence the only way I knew how.</p><p>With smoke.</p><hr><h2 id=monologue><strong>Monologue</strong></h2><p>And the man smoked.</p><p>Not for pleasure. Not for pain.
But because silence demanded punctuation.
The world had grown too loud, too insistent —
and smoke was the only language left
that didn’t need translation.</p><p>He drew the fire close to his lips,
felt it bite,
then fade into surrender.
Each drag, a question.
Each exhale, an answer he didn’t believe.</p><p>He’d seen too much of time’s crooked humour —
how it gave, only to take,
how it smiled while twisting the knife.
He had stopped chasing meaning long ago;
now he merely kept it at bay,
like a stray dog that once knew his name.</p><p>The ember glowed like a dying sun in his hand,
a tiny apocalypse contained.
He thought of the people who once tried to save him —
how they mistook his smoke for decay,
when it was only his way of praying.</p><p>To what, he no longer knew.
Gods? Ghosts?
Or just the echo of a man
who once believed he could change the ending?</p><p>The wind came, soft and uncaring,
and the ash drifted down like tired snow.
He watched it fall, and smiled —
that crooked, weary smile
of a man who’s made peace
with his own undoing.</p><p>And when the last curl of smoke rose and vanished,
he didn’t mourn it.
He simply lit another.</p><hr><h2 id=epilogue><strong>Epilogue</strong></h2><p>Madhav finally spoke.
“Still searching for salvation in smoke?”</p><p>I laughed, hoarse and hollow.
“Not salvation, Madhav. Just… companionship.”</p><p>He smiled that quiet, cruel smile —
the kind gods reserve for fools they secretly admire.</p><p>And for a moment,
the smoke between us looked like mercy.</p><hr></article></body></html>
