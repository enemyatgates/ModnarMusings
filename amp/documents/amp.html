At first glance, it seems a simple question, almost rhetorical, but the weight of it accumulates over years — decades — until it is impossible to ignore. Every deferred choice, every moment of silence, every compromise in the name of comfort or approval becomes a stone in the edifice of a life half-lived. And yet, we deceive ourselves with illusions of safety. We whisper to ourselves that letting someone else take the reins is pragmatic, even wise. But in truth, it is the beginning of surrender.</p><hr><hr><hr><h2 id=-epilogue>🕯️ EPILOGUE</h2><p>I am not trying to change the world.
