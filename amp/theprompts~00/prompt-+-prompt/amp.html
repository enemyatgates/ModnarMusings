The fusion should manifest as a cinematic, dreamlike steampunk fantasy with hyper-detailed costume and architecture.&rdquo;</p><p>SUBJECT: &ldquo;A confident woman in an intricate steampunk bodysuit adorned with gears, straps, and brass elements, standing on a sky-high balcony, gazing out over a floating city. Her long hair flows gently in the breeze as she grips the railing, exuding both strength and elegance.&rdquo;</p><p>SETTING: &ldquo;Scene set above a sea of clouds at golden hour, with a massive, ornate steampunk city suspended in the sky in the distance, spires and clockwork structures rising into the atmosphere under a glowing blue sky with scattered clouds and a visible moon.&rdquo;</p></article></body></html>
