Full stop.</p><h2 id=why-interest-rates-matter>Why Interest Rates Matter</h2><ul><li><strong>Stocks</strong>: Higher rates = lower valuations = stock prices fall. Lower rates = higher valuations = stock prices rise.</li><li><strong>Bonds</strong>: Rates and bond prices move inversely. Rates up → bond prices down.</li><li><strong>Forex</strong>: Higher rates strengthen a currency, lower rates weaken it.</li><li><strong>Commodities</strong>: Higher rates increase the cost of holding commodities, often leading to lower prices.</li></ul><p>Macro is built on the backbone of where interest rates are and where they’re going.</p><h2 id=who-controls-interest-rates>Who Controls Interest Rates?</h2><ul><li><strong>Central Banks</strong> (Federal Reserve, ECB, BOJ, etc.)</li><li>They set <strong>benchmark rates</strong> (like the Federal Funds Rate) which impact short-term borrowing.</li><li>Longer-term rates (10-year treasury yields etc.) are set by the market.</li></ul><p>Policy rates directly impact liquidity in the system:</p><ul><li>Rate hikes = liquidity drain.</li><li>Rate cuts = liquidity flood.</li></ul><h2 id=key-types-of-interest-rates>Key Types of Interest Rates</h2><ul><li><strong>Nominal Rate</strong>: The stated rate, not adjusted for inflation.</li><li><strong>Real Rate</strong>: Nominal rate minus inflation.<br>Real rates drive investment decisions.</li><li><strong>Effective Rate</strong>: The real-world rate after compounding.</li><li><strong>Overnight Rates</strong>: Like SOFR or EONIA, used for very short-term lending between banks.</li></ul><h2 id=yield-curve>Yield Curve</h2><ul><li><strong>Normal Curve</strong>: Long-term rates > short-term rates. Healthy economy.</li><li><strong>Inverted Curve</strong>: Short-term rates > long-term rates. Recession warning.</li><li>Yield curve inversions often predict a recession 6-18 months out.</li></ul><p>Traders watch the <strong>2s/10s spread</strong> (difference between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields) closely.</p><h2 id=interest-rates-and-risk-assets>Interest Rates and Risk Assets</h2><ul><li>Lower rates = Cheaper borrowing → Business growth → Higher corporate earnings → Higher stock prices.</li><li>Higher rates = Costlier borrowing → Slowdown in growth → Lower stock prices.</li></ul><p>Valuations like DCF models are hypersensitive to interest rates. A 1% change can dramatically alter fair value estimates.</p><h2 id=practical-trading-insights>Practical Trading Insights</h2><ul><li><strong>Dovish Fed</strong> (lowering rates or staying low) = bullish stocks, weak dollar, strong gold.</li><li><strong>Hawkish Fed</strong> (raising rates aggressively) = bearish stocks, strong dollar, pressure on gold and risk assets.</li><li>Watch the <strong>Fed Dot Plot</strong> for future expectations.</li><li>Keep an eye on <strong>Fed Funds Futures</strong> for market predictions of rate moves.</li></ul><h2 id=real-world-examples>Real World Examples</h2><ul><li><strong>2020 COVID Crisis</strong>: Rates cut to near zero → massive rally in risk assets.</li><li><strong>2022 Inflation Fight</strong>: Fed hikes rates at the fastest pace in decades → stocks, crypto, bonds all sell-off.</li></ul><h2 id=final-note>Final Note</h2><p>Interest rates are not just numbers — they’re a narrative.<br>Every hike or cut signals fear, greed, growth, or panic.</p><p>If you trade macro assets and you don&rsquo;t understand interest rates, you are just another player at the table who doesn&rsquo;t know the rules.</p></article></body></html>
