Basically, people on the inside.</p><p>They buy or sell based on what <em>they</em> know is coming. And while they’re legally required to disclose trades (Form 4 in the U.S.), the alpha lies in understanding the intent behind the move.</p><h2 id=why-should-you-care>Why should you care?</h2><p>Insiders don’t buy stock for fun. They either:</p><ul><li>Know something positive is cooking</li><li>Want to signal confidence</li><li>Or it’s just PR (buying 100 shares for optics)</li></ul><p>Large, <strong>clustered buying</strong> from multiple insiders = strong signal.<br>Consistent <strong>selling</strong> isn’t always bearish — could be compensation or tax-related. Context matters.</p><h2 id=types-of-insider-moves>Types of Insider Moves:</h2><ul><li><strong>Buy</strong>: Bullish if significant, especially after a dip.</li><li><strong>Sell</strong>: Not always bearish unless it&rsquo;s sudden and big.</li><li><strong>Option Exercises</strong>: Insiders exercising options can mean they&rsquo;re expecting upside, or just cashing in.</li><li><strong>Volume Spike</strong>: Sometimes you will see volume spikes in either the options or the stock itself, thats your signal. but HFT&rsquo;s Front Run that wayy before any retailer can step in.

It’s a heatmap.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final thoughts:</h2><p>Follow the money, but don&rsquo;t worship it.<br>Insiders have more info — but that doesn&rsquo;t mean their timing is perfect. If you see Multiple Insiders piling up their own stock then go for it.</p></article></body></html>
