Every publicly traded company is required to report its financial performance quarterly — that means 4 times a year.</p><p>You want volatility? This is where it is.</p><p>These reports include:</p><ul><li>Revenue</li><li>Net income</li><li>Earnings per share (EPS)</li><li>Forward guidance</li><li>And sometimes just corporate cope</li></ul><h2 id=why-do-earnings-matter>Why do earnings matter?</h2><p>Institutions trade based on expectations. If a company beats expectations, price often shoots up. If it misses, it can crash. But here’s the catch — <strong>it’s not just about numbers</strong>, it’s about <em>sentiment</em> around the numbers.</p><p>If a company reports good numbers but gives weak guidance, stock still tanks.<br>If the numbers are mid but guidance is optimistic, stock pumps.</p><h2 id=key-terms>Key Terms:</h2><ul><li><strong>EPS (Earnings Per Share)</strong>: Net income ÷ outstanding shares. Most-watched metric.</li><li><strong>Guidance</strong>: Company’s forecast for future revenue/earnings. More important than current numbers sometimes.</li><li><strong>YoY / QoQ</strong>: Year-over-year / Quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Used to spot growth or decline.</li><li><strong>Surprise</strong>: Difference between reported and expected EPS. Huge factor in post-earnings price action.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-trade-earnings>How to trade earnings?</h2><ul><li>Some people <strong>swing into earnings</strong> hoping for a pump. That&rsquo;s a coin toss.</li><li>Smart money waits for the reaction and trades the volatility after.</li><li>Even smarter ones avoid it unless there’s a solid edge or hedge in place.</li></ul><p>Watch for:</p><ul><li><strong>IV crush</strong> in options (→ [[Options Greeks]])</li><li>Volume spikes</li><li>Whiplash moves (price fakes out both directions, its great for straddles or fully hedged positions if you can manage)</li></ul><h2 id=when-is-earnings-season>When is earnings season?</h2><p>Usually starts 1–2 weeks after each quarter ends:</p><ul><li>Q1 earnings → April</li><li>Q2 → July</li><li>Q3 → October</li><li>Q4 → January</li></ul><p>Big names like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla usually go first or somewhere early — they set the tone for the market.</p><h2 id=where-to-track-earnings>Where to track earnings?</h2><ul><li><strong>TradingView Calendar</strong></li><li><strong>Yahoo Finance</strong></li><li><strong>MarketWatch</strong></li><li><strong>Seeking Alpha</strong></li><li><strong>Earnings Whispers (for dates + sentiment)</strong></li></ul><p>Set alerts for big names. If a major index stock is reporting, it can affect the whole market sentiment.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final thoughts:</h2><p>Earnings = opportunity but also risk. Every Opportunity is a risk in one form or another.
Avoid gambling unless you&rsquo;re hedged or sized small.
Let volatility settle, find a level, then plan your trade.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re holding a position into earnings — that’s not a trade, thats a bet. Unless you have satellites monitoring the parking lots of Walmart to determine wether they will perform above expectation (yes some hedge funds have used that technique to make money).</p></article></body></html>
