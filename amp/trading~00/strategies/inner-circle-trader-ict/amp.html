Huddleston. The ICT approach is focused on <strong>institutional-style trading</strong>, using advanced technical analysis combined with market structure principles to gain an edge in the market.</p><hr><h1 id=1-what-is-ict>1. <strong>What is ICT?</strong></h1><p>The ICT strategy aims to mimic the trading techniques used by institutional investors, hedge funds, and banks. It involves a deep understanding of <strong>market structure</strong>, <strong>liquidity</strong>, <strong>order flow</strong>, and <strong>price action</strong>. Unlike many retail traders who focus on common technical indicators, ICT emphasizes the analysis of <strong>price action</strong>, <strong>order blocks</strong>, and <strong>institutional footprint</strong> in the market.</p><hr><h1 id=2-core-principles-of-ict>2. <strong>Core Principles of ICT</strong></h1><ul><li><strong>Market Structure</strong>: ICT emphasizes the importance of understanding market structure — the way markets form peaks and valleys, highs and lows — to determine key support and resistance levels.</li><li><strong>Liquidity Zones</strong>: Traders are trained to identify areas in the market where liquidity is likely to be absorbed, often referred to as <strong>liquidity pools</strong> or <strong>order blocks</strong>.</li><li><strong>Institutional Footprint</strong>: The methodology focuses on reading the market as if you were an institutional trader, understanding the intentions of the larger players and positioning yourself to trade with them.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=3-key-concepts-in-ict>3. <strong>Key Concepts in ICT</strong></h1><h3 id=31-order-blocks>3.1 <strong>Order Blocks</strong></h3><p>Order blocks are the areas in the market where large institutions have previously placed buy or sell orders. These areas tend to provide future support or resistance.</p><ul><li><strong>Bullish Order Block</strong>: A market area where significant buying has occurred, usually identified by the last bearish candle before the market moves higher.</li><li><strong>Bearish Order Block</strong>: A market area where significant selling has occurred, usually identified by the last bullish candle before the market moves lower.</li></ul><p>Order blocks act as strong <strong>liquidity zones</strong>, which are key areas where price is likely to revisit for further absorption of liquidity.</p><hr><h3 id=32-fair-value-gaps-fvg>3.2 <strong>Fair Value Gaps (FVG)</strong></h3><p>Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) are areas in the market where a price gap has formed between two areas of price action. These gaps can indicate an imbalance in the market and are often areas where price will return to fill the gap.</p><ul><li><strong>FVGs</strong> act as high probability entry points, where price may revisit to complete the move and test unfilled orders.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=33-market-manipulation>3.3 <strong>Market Manipulation</strong></h3><p>ICT teaches traders how institutions manipulate markets by inducing false breakouts, <strong>stop hunting</strong>, and <strong>liquidity raids</strong>. These manipulations are designed to trigger retail traders&rsquo; stop losses and create opportunities for larger institutions to enter positions at favorable prices.</p><hr><h3 id=34-ict-concepts-for-entry>3.4 <strong>ICT Concepts for Entry</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)</strong>: A strategy used by ICT traders where they look for a retracement to a level where the price is likely to reverse in the direction of the trend. This often occurs at an <strong>order block</strong> or <strong>FVG</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>OTE 61.8%</strong>: This is a Fibonacci level where price often retraces during a strong trend, providing a potential entry point.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Power of Three</strong>: A principle in ICT where market moves occur in three phases: an accumulation phase, a manipulation phase, and a distribution phase. This principle helps identify the overall trend direction and key zones of entry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Institutional Order Flow</strong>: ICT teaches that market moves are often dictated by <strong>institutional order flow</strong>. By analyzing order blocks, FVGs, and liquidity zones, traders aim to enter positions that align with institutional flows.</p></li></ul><hr><h1 id=4-ict-trading-tools-and-indicators>4. <strong>ICT Trading Tools and Indicators</strong></h1><p>While ICT does not rely heavily on traditional technical indicators, the methodology incorporates a few custom tools:</p><ul><li><strong>ICT Time and Price Model</strong>: This involves studying the <strong>time of day</strong> and <strong>price levels</strong> when significant price action tends to occur, helping traders identify high-probability setups.</li><li><strong>Fibonacci Retracement</strong>: ICT traders use Fibonacci levels to identify potential price reversal points, with special emphasis on the 61.8% level.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=5-advanced-ict-strategies>5. <strong>Advanced ICT Strategies</strong></h1><ul><li><strong>The 20-50-80 Rule</strong>: A method of identifying high-probability market moves. Traders will look for price action to move 20% in one direction, 50% in the opposite direction, and then 80% back in the original direction for a significant move.</li><li><strong>The London Open</strong>: A specific strategy focused on the <strong>London session open</strong>. ICT teaches traders to look for market imbalances and liquidity grabs during this time to place trades with the expected institutional bias.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=6-risk-management-in-ict>6. <strong>Risk Management in ICT</strong></h1><p>ICT places a strong emphasis on <strong>risk management</strong>. Key principles include:</p><ul><li><strong>Position Sizing</strong>: Risk a small percentage of your trading capital on each trade, typically around 1-2%.</li><li><strong>Stop Loss Placement</strong>: Stop losses are typically placed just beyond liquidity zones or order blocks to minimize the risk of being stopped out by market noise.</li><li><strong>Risk-Reward Ratio</strong>: ICT emphasizes high reward-to-risk ratios. Aim for trades with a minimum reward of 3x the risk, although higher ratios are often targeted.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=7-examples-of-ict-trades>7. <strong>Examples of ICT Trades</strong></h1><h3 id=example-1-bullish-order-block>Example 1: <strong>Bullish Order Block</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Price Action</strong>: Price creates a bullish trend and forms a bullish order block.</li><li><strong>Entry</strong>: Wait for price to return to the order block and enter at the 61.8% retracement.</li><li><strong>Exit</strong>: Set a target at a liquidity pool or significant resistance area.</li></ol><h3 id=example-2-fvg-entry>Example 2: <strong>FVG Entry</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Price Action</strong>: A significant gap forms in the market, creating a Fair Value Gap.</li><li><strong>Entry</strong>: Enter the trade when price revisits the FVG and shows signs of reversal.</li><li><strong>Exit</strong>: Exit the trade when price reaches an institutional target zone or major support/resistance.</li></ol><hr><h1 id=8-advantages-of-ict>8. <strong>Advantages of ICT</strong></h1><ul><li><strong>Institutional Perspective</strong>: ICT provides retail traders with tools and strategies to trade like institutional players, giving them a competitive edge.</li><li><strong>Market Structure Focus</strong>: By focusing on market structure, ICT helps traders understand the bigger picture and avoid getting caught in false moves.</li><li><strong>Liquidity Awareness</strong>: ICT teaches traders to look for liquidity zones and understand how institutional players move the market, which helps them trade with the market rather than against it.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=9-conclusion>9. <strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>ICT offers a comprehensive and detailed trading methodology designed to help traders understand and execute strategies based on institutional market behavior. By focusing on market structure, liquidity zones, and institutional order flow, ICT traders aim to identify high-probability setups that align with the larger market participants.</p><hr><p>[[Order Blocks]] [[Price Action]] [[Stop Hunting]] [[Risk Management]] [[Arbitrage]]</p></article></body></html>
