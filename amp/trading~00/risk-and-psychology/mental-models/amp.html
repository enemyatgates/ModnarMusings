In trading, they help you react rationally instead of emotionally.</p><hr><h2 id=1-why-mental-models-matter-in-trading>1. <strong>Why Mental Models Matter in Trading</strong></h2><ul><li>Trading is less about &ldquo;calling tops and bottoms&rdquo; and more about thinking probabilistically and surviving over the long run.</li><li>Emotions like fear, greed, FOMO kill traders faster than bad strategies.</li><li>Mental models force your brain to operate systematically.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=2-important-mental-models-for-traders>2. <strong>Important Mental Models for Traders</strong></h2><h3 id=risk-vs-reward><strong>Risk vs Reward</strong></h3><p>Every decision is about <strong>expected value</strong>:</p><p>$$
\text{Expected Value (EV)} = (\text{Probability of Win} \times \text{Reward}) - (\text{Probability of Loss} \times \text{Risk})
$$</p><p>Only take trades where EV is positive.</p><hr><h3 id=second-order-thinking><strong>Second-Order Thinking</strong></h3><p>Don&rsquo;t just think about the immediate effect, think about the effect of that effect.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If the FED cuts rates, stocks might rally&mldr; but if inflation persists, the rally might be fake.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Always think: <em>And then what?</em></p><hr><h3 id=inversion><strong>Inversion</strong></h3><p>Instead of thinking “how do I succeed?”, think:</p><blockquote><p>“How do I avoid failing?”</p></blockquote><p>In trading: Avoid blowing up your account first. Profit comes second.</p><hr><h3 id=survivorship-bias><strong>Survivorship Bias</strong></h3><p>You only hear from the winners. Most traders who blew up aren&rsquo;t telling their story. Don&rsquo;t think trading is easier than it actually is.</p><hr><h3 id=loss-aversion><strong>Loss Aversion</strong></h3><p>Humans hate losses more than they love gains. You MUST be willing to take small losses consistently. That&rsquo;s what keeps you alive.</p><hr><h3 id=confirmation-bias><strong>Confirmation Bias</strong></h3><p>You will automatically search for information that confirms your current bias. Always actively look for reasons you might be wrong.</p><hr><h3 id=probability-and-luck><strong>Probability and Luck</strong></h3><p>Short term outcomes are random. Even good trades can lose money. Focus on process, not outcomes.</p><hr><h3 id=margin-of-safety><strong>Margin of Safety</strong></h3><p>Have enough capital buffer so that unexpected moves don&rsquo;t wipe you out. Risk small.</p><hr><h2 id=3-summary>3. <strong>Summary</strong></h2><ul><li>Mental Models > Emotions.</li><li>Trading is probabilistic, not deterministic.</li><li>Process > Outcome.</li><li>Protect downside, upside will take care of itself.</li></ul><hr></article></body></html>
