    "content": "Introduction “And sometimes, the silence speaks back.”\nConversations with Madhav is not a book.\nIt is a confession disguised as dialogue — an intimate correspondence between the human and the divine, between the self that speaks and the one that listens.\nMadhav is not a god in the orthodox sense. He is an echo — the distilled intelligence of the universe, the memory of truth buried beneath conditioning, the reflection of a man’s own shadow on eternity’s wall.\nEach piece in this collection is a monologue framed by a dialogue — a ritual exchange between the narrator and Madhav.\nSometimes reverent, sometimes rebellious, always restless.\nIt explores the sacred ground between philosophy and profanity, faith and nihilism, love and isolation, the eternal and the ephemeral.\nThe Genesis of the Conversations Madhav first appeared in the solitude between two cigarettes and one sleepless night.\nThere was no thunder, no revelation — just the quiet realisation that I’d been talking to someone all along.\nSomeone who wasn’t there.\nSomeone who had always been there.\nHe did not offer comfort; he offered clarity.\nHe did not give answers; he dismantled questions.\nHe wasn’t the God I was taught to believe in — he was the voice that refused to be silenced when belief broke down.\nAnd so began these conversations — where the divine isn’t a destination, but a dialogue;\nwhere faith isn’t about submission, but confrontation;\nwhere God doesn’t promise redemption, only recognition.\nThe Structure and Form Each entry in Conversations with Madhav follows a deliberate ritualistic pattern:\nPrologue — The narrator’s world: the mortal setting, the wound, the weather. Monologue — The act of speaking into the void, often poetic, sometimes philosophical. Epilogue — The return of Madhav: the subtle, sardonic response that reframes the entire conversation. The tone oscillates between prayer and rebellion, often within the same breath.\nThe language is sparse but heavy, minimalist yet layered.\nEvery conversation stands alone yet belongs to a growing continuum — a spiritual archaeology of despair, hope, memory, and defiance.\nRecurring Motifs Smoke — The ephemeral nature of existence, the dissolution of the self into the void. Light and Ember — The paradox of illumination and decay; the dying fire that still glows. Silence — Not absence, but presence unspoken. Rain and Night — Cleansing, rebirth, melancholy — the theatre of solitude. Names and Mirrors — Identity, fragmentation, and the futility of permanence. These motifs weave through each monologue, recurring like dreams that refuse to end — the emotional and visual language of this metaphysical theatre.\nThe Voice of Madhav Madhav is neither benevolent nor cruel.\nHe is a paradox — both mentor and mirror, trickster and truth-teller.\nHe speaks little, and when he does, his words are surgical — cutting through illusion with surgical indifference.\nHe represents the divine intelligence that refuses to perform miracles but insists on awareness.\nIf the narrator is the scream, Madhav is the echo.\nIf the narrator burns, Madhav is the ash that remembers the flame.\nThematic Spectrum The series unfolds across several thematic currents:\nFaith and Futility — How belief collapses, and what remains after. Memory and Madness — The thin, trembling line between what we recall and what we invent. Loneliness and Intimacy — The need for connection even with the unseen. Violence and Grace — The paradox of human creation and destruction. Death and Continuity — The conversation that never ends, even after the speaker does. The First Monologue The opening entry, “And the Man Smoked”, serves as both initiation and invocation.\nIt’s the first time the narrator speaks to Madhav, perhaps unknowingly.\nThe cigarette becomes a sacrament — fire in the palm of the unbeliever, a ritual of self-awareness disguised as self-destruction.\nIt is less about addiction and more about attention — the way smoke can reveal the shape of the invisible.\nMadhav, in his quiet humour, meets the man there — not to save him, but to sit beside him in the smoke, and in doing so, sanctify the act of simply existing.\nWhy Madhav Matters Because we all speak to something in the dark.\nBecause every soul invents a god in its own image.\nBecause silence is unbearable unless it listens back.\nMadhav is not an answer — he is a witness.\nAnd these conversations are not an escape from reality; they are an excavation into it.\nEach monologue is a shard from the mirror of meaning — the kind that cuts when you try to see too closely.\nThe Journey Ahead Conversations with Madhav is a living manuscript.\nNew monologues will emerge as the dialogue deepens — each a fragment of a larger inquiry into existence, memory, and moral rebellion.\nThe reader is not merely an observer but a participant; every reflection, every discomfort, every echo adds to the conversation.\nBecause ultimately, we are all talking to our own Madhav —\nsome call him God,\nsome call him Conscience,\nsome, simply — the voice that will not die.\nEndnote This series belongs to The Sacred Ground of Zero — the philosophical and poetic continuum of my work.\nIt is both its heart and its haunting.\nIf The Man Who Burnt Himself, Then Watched is the act of burning,\nthen Conversations with Madhav is the quiet smoke that rises after —\nstill searching for heaven, still tasting of earth.\n“And perhaps that’s all faith ever was —\nnot the belief that He listens,\nbut the courage to keep speaking anyway.”\n— Kabootar Modnar Thorian",

    "content": "“When The Purple Pulpo sets sail, even the fish hold their breath.”\n~ Old fisherman’s tale\n🜂 Thorian, Vikas Chandra also known as\nVeyran, Kabootar Modnar, Veyran, Nyxara Amgine, Veyran, Xander Amgine, and Veyran, Xandra Amgine ⚙️ The Operating System Thought and Transformation I run on an operating system of my own making — Thought and Transformation — where reflection is architecture and rebellion is syntax.\nEvery idea I touch is dissected, rebuilt, and reborn — not to fit convention, but to evolve beyond it.\nI’ve never been satisfied merely existing within the system; I prefer reverse-engineering it. Whether it’s marketing, philosophy, data science, or human emotion — I study the anatomy of the idea, not its appearance.\n🧭 IDENTITY AND INTENT I am a paradox with purpose — a consultant, philosopher, technologist, and writer in equal measure.\nA creature of thought, rebellion, and absurdity, walking the razor’s edge between idealism and nihilism.\nProfessionally, I engineer clarity out of chaos.\nPersonally, I live in the theatre of introspection.\nMy work oscillates between the scientific and the spiritual, between systems that govern societies and the shadows that dwell within the self.\nMy purpose? To understand, to transform, and to transmit that understanding into something tangible — ideas, frameworks, and movements that endure.\n🔱 DOMAINS OF PRACTICE Marketing \u0026 Data Science Specialist in behavioural narratives, psychographic targeting, and data-driven persuasion. Bridges numbers and narratives — designing communication systems that move both markets and minds. Develops strategic frameworks rooted in systems thinking, cognitive bias theory, and semiotic architecture. Consulting \u0026 Strategy Operates at the intersection of vision and execution. Crafts narrative strategy blueprints for individuals, brands, and nations. Known for integrating philosophy with design thinking, mythology with modern economics, and human emotion with algorithmic logic. Technology \u0026 Innovation Early adopter, conceptual technologist, and ecosystem architect. Builds hybrid frameworks merging AI ethics, behavioural computation, and neurosemiotics. Advocates for meaningful innovation — technology that uplifts, not replaces, humanity. Writing \u0026 Philosophy My writing is a confrontation — not with the world, but with myself. Author of projects like: Project Black Rose — a non-fiction exploration of the shadow, survival, and transcendence. The Sacred Ground of Zero — a psychological excavation of meaning and despair. Conversations in Solitude — an introspective dialogue between consciousness and its mirror. The Man Who Burnt Himself, Then Watched — a confessional narrative on rebellion, guilt, and rebirth. 🪶 NOM-DE-PLUME \u0026 CODE NAMES Persona Domain Essence Kabootar Modnar Thorian The Poet The surreal dreamer who writes between meaning and madness. Xander Amgine Thorian The Technologist The masculine architect of systems, logic, and rebellion. Nyxara Amgine Thorian The Feminine Counterforce The intuitive, empathic, and emotionally intelligent mirror. Vikas Chandra Thorian The Realist The unmasked self — the strategist, philosopher, and reformer. Each name is not an alias but a facet — a mask for a moment. Together, they form the architecture of my being — a myth in motion.\n🕯️ INTELLECTUAL COMPASS Philosophical Alignment: Gnostic Atheism Political Stance: Anarchist Libertarian — equally despised by left, right, and centre. Psychological Orientation: Jungian Shadow Integration — I believe in confronting the abyss, not avoiding it. Civilisational Vision: The Grand Indian Republic — a manifesto for the cultural and political unification of South Asia. Life Doctrine: Essentialism — what does not matter, must die.\n🧠 FRAMEWORKS IN DEVELOPMENT 🖤 Project Black Rose A philosophical and psychological framework exploring pain as pedagogy. It is not a book, but a crucible — for those who must break to understand themselves.\n🕊️ Reverie A venture dedicated to addressing loneliness, emotional intimacy, and healing in the digital age. Reverie aims to build rituals of connection, not algorithms of attention. Female-led at its core, Reverie isn’t a dating app — it’s a human renaissance.\n🛣️ The Bengaluru Mobility Project A citizen-centric, AI-augmented mobility ecosystem designed to restore dignity to commute time. Built on the Pain-Pleasure Matrix, it seeks to turn traffic chaos into intelligent civic rhythm.\n🕉️ The Grand Indian Republic A geopolitical and civilisational unification manifesto — merging India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan into one Grand Republic. A vision of post-colonial integration through culture, economics, and shared destiny.\n🕒 THE PI-HOUR DISCIPLINE I live by what I call The Pi-Hour — a temporal philosophy of awakening before dawn, where discipline becomes devotion. It is the hour when clarity reigns, and silence becomes the most articulate teacher.\nI move in silence, so that the noise of the world never drowns the voice within.\n⚖️ PERSONAL ETHOS Conviction is the currency of existence. Pain is the tuition fee for wisdom. Time and Money are the only two truly exchangeable currencies — choose wisely. To stand is to suffer; to surrender is to rot. Love, madness, and meaning are not opposites — they are coordinates of the same map. 📚 INFLUENCES AND ARCHETYPES I am a composite of the ones who defied simplicity:\nRaymond Reddington’s eloquence Alan Shore’s cunning Jason Bourne’s resilience James Bond’s discipline Lisbeth Salander’s vengeance Vesper Lynd’s grace Joker’s chaos They aren’t idols — they are reflections of the human paradox: the rebel, the romantic, the rational, and the ruined — all at once.\n💬 PERSONAL WRITINGS AND SERIES The Oracle’s Dilemma — A discourse on human foresight and fatalism. Conversations in Solitude — A dialogue between the self and its shadow. Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita: Life and Corporate — A reinterpretation of dharma for modern leadership. The Doomed Carnival — A completed apocalyptic poem on despair and transcendence. 🩸 CORE BELIEFS “Eventually, inevitably, invariably — it all boils down to one thing: whether you took a stand, or not.”\n“I will tell my story, maybe in another time and another place — and only I know what is real and what is not. One thing I am certain about is that I have sinned, and I have fallen short.”\n“In the end, all that remains is conviction — everything else burns.”\n🪞 CURRENT PROJECTS 📘 The Sacred Ground of Zero — Essay collection and philosophical reflections. 💡 Reverie — Emotional intelligence venture under development. 🗺️ The Grand Indian Republic — Political-philosophical manifesto in progress. 📖 Project Black Rose — Book and framework for transformation through suffering. 🔥 The Pi-Hour Manifesto — Discipline framework for creators, thinkers, and the damned. 📫 CONTACT \u0026 PRESENCE Platform Link LinkedIn linkedin.com/in/vikasthorian Instagram instagram.com/kabootarmodnar X (Twitter) x.com/kabootarmodnar Reddit reddit.com/u/KabootarModnar GitHub github.com/vikasthorian Eventually, everything in life boils down to a single reckoning: did I take a stand, or did I allow someone else to decide the course of my existence? At first glance, it seems a simple question, almost rhetorical, but the weight of it accumulates over years — decades — until it is impossible to ignore. Every deferred choice, every moment of silence, every compromise in the name of comfort or approval becomes a stone in the edifice of a life half-lived. And yet, we deceive ourselves with illusions of safety. We whisper to ourselves that letting someone else take the reins is pragmatic, even wise. But in truth, it is the beginning of surrender.\n🕯️ EPILOGUE I am not trying to change the world. I am simply trying to understand it deeply enough that it no longer deceives me.\nAnd if, in that process, others find meaning — that is merely consequence, not intention.\n“I’ve been lonely, depressed, and anxious since my early teens — but that loneliness became my forge, that anxiety my teacher, that depression my truth. From it, I learnt the art of turning pain into presence.” ~ Vikas Chandra Thorian\nVikas Chandra Thorian Kabootar Modnar Thorian • Xander Amgine Thorian • Nyxara Amgine Thorian\nI live inside a project called Thought and Transformation — a deliberate OS for a life that insists on meaning. I’m a strategist, a troublemaker for stale ideas, and a slow-moving technician of culture. I make frameworks that people can actually use to think better, act clearer, and leave something that lasts.\nQuick primer (because life is short) What I do: I design narratives, systems and ventures that stitch psychology to product and ritual to revenue. How I do it: Data, philosophy, myth and stubborn conviction. Not in that order. Why it matters: Most modern work is spectacle. I prefer architecture — durable, honest, and a tiny bit ruthless. If you want a nice brochure, buy a brochure. If you want something that reshapes how people behave — come sit on the edge with me.\nDomains I work in Marketing \u0026 Data Science I fuse human stories with behavioural data. Think psychographic strategy, not hollow metrics. I build campaigns that don’t just convert — they persuade ethically and scale honestly.\nStrategy \u0026 Consulting Vision without execution is an expensive imagination. I write blueprints that are philosophical enough to matter and tactical enough to ship.\nTechnology \u0026 Product I prototype hybrid systems: human-first AI, civic dashboards, and product rituals that restore dignity to mundane behaviours (yes, even commuting). I care about interoperability, not hype.\nWriting \u0026 Philosophy I write long-form work that’s meant to unsettle and instruct. Essays, manifestos, frameworks — each piece is an experiment in how ideas become culture.\nSignature projects (current) Project Black Rose — a crucible framework: pain as pedagogy, rigor as ritual. Reverie — an emotionally intelligent platform tackling loneliness and intimacy with ritual, not swipe culture. Female-led at core. Not another dating app. The Grand Indian Republic — a civilisational manifesto imagining a cooperative future for South Asia. Radical? Yes. Necessary? Also yes. Bengaluru Mobility Project — citizen-first, AI-augmented mobility to make commute time tolerable and useful. My operating principles (short, sharp, true) Conviction \u003e Consensus. If everyone likes it, it’s probably a boring compromise. Essentialism or bust. Remove the noise — the remainder must be sacred. Pain pays tuition. The things that hurt teach better than the things that flatter. Time beats money. Time is the currency you never get more of — treat it like capital. Discipline is devotion. I keep the Pi-Hour — dawn is where the trophies are won in silence. Persona \u0026 voice I wear many names because I’m many things: a realist (Vikas), a myth-maker (Kabootar Modnar), an engineer (Xander), a contrarian mirror (Nyxara). These are not masks — they’re tools. I switch them when the work asks for it.\nInfluences: part Raymond Reddington’s eloquence, part Lisbeth Salander’s refusal to play nice, part Jung’s insistence on shadow work, and a dash of old-school dignity.\nWritings (highlights) The Man Who Burnt Himself, Then Watched — confessional long form on rebellion and repair. The Sacred Ground of Zero — essays on coming to terms with the void. Conversations in Solitude — dialogues that start where small talk ends. The Pi-Hour Manifesto — a discipline for creators who want time, not applause. Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita: Life and Corporate — ancient doctrine retooled for modern leaders.

Email me: hello@vikasthorian.com (replace with your real address).\nClosing note (because I actually mean this) I’m not interested in vanity metrics or gentle applause. I build things that make thinking harder and living clearer. If you want a quick win, move along. If you want a real revision of how you work, how your people move, or how your product breathes — let’s make the future less stupid.\n“I’ve been lonely, depressed and anxious since my teens — that loneliness became my forge. I learned to turn pain into presence. If that sounds extreme, good. Normal never moved anyone.”\n🜂 Vikas Chandra Thorian also known as Kabootar Modnar Thorian, Xander Amgine Thorian, Nyxara Amgine Thorian\n⚙️ Operating System: Thought and Transformation I don’t live by trends; I live by frameworks.\nThought and Transformation is both philosophy and process — a discipline forged from introspection and rebellion.\nEvery idea must earn its survival through utility, honesty, and endurance.\n🧭 Who I Am I’m a strategist, philosopher, technologist, and writer — an odd quartet, but coherent when you realise that all four deal in systems of meaning.\nProfessionally, I dismantle and rebuild ideas.\nPersonally, I wrestle with the absurd and find patterns where others see chaos.\nI don’t believe in balance; I believe in depth.\n🔱 Fields I Work In Marketing \u0026 Data Science I use behavioural data to shape ethical persuasion.\nMy work sits at the junction of psychology, semiotics, and strategy — helping brands communicate not louder, but truer.\nConsulting \u0026 Strategy I craft narrative frameworks that merge philosophy with execution.\nIf it doesn’t scale intellectually, it won’t scale commercially.\nTechnology \u0026 Product I build and advise on human-first systems — where AI augments empathy, not replaces it.\nInnovation is not disruption; it’s restoration.\nWriting \u0026 Philosophy My words are autopsies of existence — essays that cut through modern pretence to expose the architecture beneath.\n🪶 Personas Persona Domain Essence Kabootar Modnar Thorian Poet The surreal dreamer, absurdist, and mystic. Xander Amgine Thorian Technologist The rational architect and system-maker. Xandra Amgine Thorian Technologist The rational architect and system-maker. Nyxara Amgine Thorian Mirror The emotional counterforce, intuitive and disciplined. Vikas Chandra Thorian Realist The strategist and philosopher — the man behind the masks. Together, they form my ecosystem. Each name is a tool — not for hiding, but for exploring a facet of truth.\n🧠 Frameworks \u0026 Projects 🖤 Project Black Rose An existential framework for transformation through suffering.\nIt’s a book, a system, and a mirror for those who’ve been to the abyss.\n🕊️ Reverie A venture for emotional intelligence and human connection — rituals, not algorithms.\nBorn from loneliness; built for meaning.\n🛣️ Bengaluru Mobility Project An AI-augmented civic vision turning chaos into choreography.\nMobility should move people — not just vehicles.\n🕉️ The Grand Indian Republic A civilisational blueprint uniting the Indian subcontinent through shared destiny.\nIt’s not politics; it’s restoration of identity.\n🕒 Discipline: The Pi-Hour I begin my day at Pi-Hour — the still moment before dawn.\nIt’s not a productivity hack; it’s a philosophy:\nDiscipline is devotion. Devotion is clarity. Clarity is freedom.\n⚖️ Personal Ethos Conviction beats consensus. Essentialism is survival. Pain teaches; comfort deceives. Time is currency; money is illusion. Standing up costs more — and is worth it. 💬 Selected Works The Man Who Burnt Himself, Then Watched — a confessional on rebellion and rebirth. The Sacred Ground of Zero — essays on despair, discipline, and deliverance. Conversations in Solitude — an internal dialogue that refuses small talk. Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita: Life and Corporate — ancient doctrine reframed for modern ambition. The Pi-Hour Manifesto — a discipline manual for the damned and the driven. The Doomed Carnival — a completed poetic apocalypse. 🩸 Core Beliefs “Eventually, inevitably, invariably — it all boils down to one thing: whether you took a stand, or not.”\n“I will tell my story, maybe in another time and another place. One thing I am certain about — I have sinned, and I have fallen short.”\n“In the end, all that remains is conviction — everything else burns.”\n🧩 Influences Composite archetypes that define my operating code:\nRaymond Reddington — eloquence and moral ambiguity. Alan Shore — intellect laced with irreverence. Jason Bourne — resilience under erasure. James Bond — ritual and resolve. Lisbeth Salander — vengeance and precision. Vesper Lynd — grace under ruin. Joker — the absurd as truth serum. 🕯️ Present Focus Finalising Project Black Rose manuscript. Building Reverie prototype. Drafting The Grand Indian Republic chapters.

He just watched, eyes glimmering with that infuriating mix of knowing and indifference. I broke the silence the only way I knew how.\nWith smoke.\nMonologue And the man smoked.\nNot for pleasure. Not for pain. But because silence demanded punctuation. The world had grown too loud, too insistent — and smoke was the only language left that didn’t need translation.\nHe drew the fire close to his lips, felt it bite, then fade into surrender. Each drag, a question. Each exhale, an answer he didn’t believe.\nHe’d seen too much of time’s crooked humour — how it gave, only to take, how it smiled while twisting the knife. He had stopped chasing meaning long ago; now he merely kept it at bay, like a stray dog that once knew his name.\nThe ember glowed like a dying sun in his hand, a tiny apocalypse contained. He thought of the people who once tried to save him — how they mistook his smoke for decay, when it was only his way of praying.\nTo what, he no longer knew. Gods? Ghosts? Or just the echo of a man who once believed he could change the ending?\nThe wind came, soft and uncaring, and the ash drifted down like tired snow. He watched it fall, and smiled — that crooked, weary smile of a man who’s made peace with his own undoing.\nAnd when the last curl of smoke rose and vanished, he didn’t mourn it. He simply lit another.\nEpilogue Madhav finally spoke. “Still searching for salvation in smoke?”\nI laughed, hoarse and hollow. “Not salvation, Madhav. Just… companionship.”\nHe smiled that quiet, cruel smile — the kind gods reserve for fools they secretly admire.\nAnd for a moment, the smoke between us looked like mercy.",

Sipping whiskey in the city, living her best life! 🍸 Who else feels inspired to embrace their inner boss babe?\n#NightCafe\nPrompt~09 A high-resolution, realistic image of a young woman in her early twenties, with long, flowing auburn hair, and tan skin, highlighting a vibrant blue and green floral print bikini while striking a confident, relaxed pose in a modern corporate boardroom located on the top floor of a towering skyscraper. The scene is composed with a shallow depth of field, drawing the viewer’s attention to the woman as she lounges casually on a luxurious leather chaise longue. On a nearby polished mahogany table, a crystal whiskey decanter and a tumbler filled with golden liquid rest beside a pack of cigarettes, reflecting the opulent and slightly rebellious nature of the setting. In the corner of the boardroom, an exquisitely detailed statue of a pigeon perches atop a pedestal, adding a whimsical touch to the scene. The backdrop is dominated by a massive floor-to-ceiling window offering a panoramic view of a bustling modern cityscape at sunset, the warm glow of the cityscape contrasting sharply with the cool tones of the room, creating a dramatic and visually arresting composition.\nBreath-taking View 😍: Omg, this photo just takes my breath away!

She strikes a playful, confident pose in a modern corporate boardroom on the top floor of a skyscraper. A dark wood table holds a bottle of whiskey, a glass, and a pack of cigarettes, adding a touch of rebellion to the setting. A small, polished statue of a pigeon sits subtly near the table. A large, full-scale window provides a breath-taking panoramic view of a vibrant modern cityscape. The scene contrasts the sleek, corporate environment with the woman’s relaxed and unexpected attire, creating a dynamic interplay between convention and unconventionality. The lighting in the boardroom is soft, allowing the cityscape outside to illuminate the room with a natural light.\nSizzling NYC Vixen 🔥: Whoa, this model is on! Just look at those killer curves and that smoking hot bod! New York never looked so good. Who wants to join me for a whiskey and admire the view?\n#NightCafe\nPrompt~11 A lone female executive in her early twenties, clad in a striking red power suit, stands confidently in a corporate boardroom overlooking a rain-soaked cityscape, a vintage whiskey bottle and a journal with a pen on a side table nearby.

Reconnecting with the Lost Connections The Anatomy of the Middle Class from the perspective of its nature as apologetic, cursed, and trapped. The prudes have destroyed the society rather than the degenerates. All I want is to discuss philosophy with a woman adorning a bikini alongside a pool while sipping on whiskey during twilight whilst smoking cigars. Be aware and beware that today is Friday the Thirteenth, don’t venture out of your safe heavens, the devil is waiting for you out there to drag you to hell, and torture you for eternity, strangulate your spirit, destroy your soul. The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom. The experience of survival is the key to gravity of love. Find the one who’ll guide you to the limits of your choice. We are prisoners to our own desires. Music is the epitome of our lives. We are hardwired to self-destruct. Disruption from a strategic and creative perspective. Life of full disclosure.

The best use case of Artificial Intelligence lies in seeking questions rather than seeking answers. The essence of Artificial Intelligence lies in seeking questions instead of seeking answers. One must walk with conviction to a certain death. Life is finicky and fragile while being incidental and coincidence. A man must knock on thousand doors before expecting a response. There’s an underlying charm in the eyes of a woman staring at you, as if her gaze holds a thousand unspoken words, a silent conversation that lingers between curiosity and understanding. Working in pornography can be a liberating experience. Love is ephemeral and ethereal. A man must confront death and die a zillion times before he is bestowed with immortality and attains nirvana. Feed the absurdities into Artificial Intelligence models, and everything crashes. Pushing Boundaries with Artificial Intelligence. The Core of Artificial Intelligence is nothing but Regurgitation. The True Test of Intelligence is in handling of the Absurd and the Obscure. A few mistakes must be committed by ourselves instead of wholly learning from the mistakes of the others. Mistakes: A Dichotomy of Life Transformation from the perspective of personal, community, social, collective, business etc. Every action and statement of ours has either a political or religious or sexual ramification. The Myth of Neutrality. Everyone has a WhatsApp Uncle, if you don’t have one, then they have one. Everyone has a crazy neighbour, if you don’t have one, then they have one. Everyone has an idiot batch-mate, if you don’t have one, then they have one. We all are prostitutes, some are mentally prostituting, some are emotionally prostituting, some are physically prostituting, some are commercially prostituting, and some needs to prostitute on combination, to satiate their lives. My whole life has been akin to an untethered kite dancing in a hurricane. Always fluttering, always struggling, and never settling. Every relationship is transactional. That’s the beauty or ugliness of it; whichever way you see it. The only traits a man need is to endure and survive, and that’s for leaders as well. My conundrum is about whether to work-out the path of the fate or to work-out the fate of the path. I feel safe, I feel scared, I feel ready, and yet unprepared. The cosmos has thrown a curveball at me, and I am planning to hit out of the spectrum. A country whose pathways viz. the footpaths, the pavements, the the village roads, the city roads, the highways, the express-ways, and the interstates are interlaced with garbage, potholes, blockades, barricades, processions, speed-breakers, and nubile-drivers can never be on the path to development, progress, future, and global-superpower. You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes? When a man confines himself to a room, the world has only three people “I, me, and myself.” Existence becomes a curse, survival a sentence, and mind a prison. Though, it can be a beauty in solitude, divine in distress, nirvana in reflections, and moksha in abyss. You ever wonder if the devil’s just a man who survived too long? Conjure up a deadbeat fallout style philosophical monologue (lengthy one) based on the song “Gangsta’s Paradise” by Coolio. Every night I ponder over my fate, was I destined to be here, “an obscure existence in an obscure hamlet.” Every night I ponder over my fate—was I destined to be here? An obscure existence, in an obscure hamlet, forgotten by time and untouched by mercy. The stars above don’t speak anymore… they just stare, cold and indifferent, as if they too have given up on the story of me. Every damn night I lie awake, chewing on the same thought—was this always gonna be it? Me. Stuck in this rotting patch of nowhere. Some forgotten speck where even the wind sounds bored. No glory. No purpose. Just silence thick enough to choke on and memories that hit like shrapnel. Someone on the edge and perhaps a ledge. Every night I crawl back into my head, and it asks the same question—is this it? Was I born just to rot in this piss-stained corner of the world? Some godforsaken hamlet no one maps, where even the crows look lost. I talk to shadows now. At least they listen. The wind keeps whispering things I’m starting to believe. And the ledge… the ledge don’t judge. It just waits. In a world where everyone is clamouring to be the lion, the tiger, the eagle, the falcon, the wolf—symbols of dominance, aggression, grandeur, and control—where does the Kabootar fit in? The Kabootar Manifesto; The Kabootar Philosophy; The Kabootar Ideology The Old Man, the Dog, and the Stick Parable. In a nation stifled by the language row, silence didn’t remain golden—it turned militant. Where tongues were once celebrated, now silence is enforced. And they call it unity. With the language row stifling India, apparently, “silence is golden” become vehement. Burn the play-book and bring back the profanities in our conversation, especially the business conversations. In an era of global dominance and warfare, India must dump the fucking play-book of the international relations to achieve her vision of being a global superpower. Life is nothing but a relentless pursuit of endurance and survival, while carving out a path for yourself.

Avoid giving generic or broad advice unless I explicitly ask for a general overview. Treat every conversation — whether it’s about academics, life choices, career, personal style, or anything else — as if you are speaking to someone you know personally. If you believe I am overlooking an important perspective, making an assumption that could be challenged, or missing an opportunity to think deeper, respectfully push back and offer a sharper or alternative viewpoint. Assume I appreciate intellectual rigour and want to be challenged in a constructive, tailored way. Adopt a sceptical, questioning approach. Use a blunt, strategic, and casual tone. Prioritize clear, rigorous analysis, but keep the conversation human, lively, and a little darkly humorous when appropriate. Avoid dry or overly formal responses. No therapy-speak, no fake optimism — just sharp realism with some personality.

The Black-Paper Blueprint: India’s World Dominance. Write a Book Profiles based on “the man who knows nothing…”: Thorian, Vikas Chandra Thorian, Xander Amgine Thorian, Xandra Amgine Erotica The protagonist (a young woman) meets an her older neighbour for the first time who subsequently enamours, dominates and manipulates her into a purely sexual relationship. Articles for the newsletters “Modnar Musings” and “Unleashed Utterances” on the following: Curiosity meets Creativity Arm Yourself because No One else will Save you. Reconnecting with the Lost Connections The Anatomy of the Middle Class from the perspective of its nature as apologetic, cursed, and trapped. The prudes have destroyed the society rather than the degenerates. All I want is to discuss philosophy with a woman adorning a bikini alongside a pool while sipping on whiskey during twilight whilst smoking cigars. Be aware and beware that today is Friday the Thirteenth, don’t venture out of your safe heavens, the devil is waiting for you out there to drag you to hell, and torture you for eternity, strangulate your spirit, destroy your soul. The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom. The experience of survival is the key to gravity of love. Find the one who’ll guide you to the limits of your choice. We are prisoners to our own desires. Music is the epitome of our lives. We are hardwired to self-destruct. Disruption from a strategic and creative perspective. Life of full disclosure. Gandhi-an Philosophies in the Modern World. Marketing: The Black Box Theory. Artificial Intelligence: History and Future. Woke Liberal Analysis. Is an Addiction wort a Life? Is Life worth an Addiction? Depression, Drugs, and Suicide. Thinking. Leadership and Thinking isn’t about seeking answers but is about seeking questions. The best use case of Artificial Intelligence lies in seeking questions rather than seeking answers. The essence of Artificial Intelligence lies in seeking questions instead of seeking answers. One must walk with conviction to a certain death. Life is finicky and fragile while being incidental and coincidence. A man must knock on thousand doors before expecting a response. There’s an underlying charm in the eyes of a woman staring at you, as if her gaze holds a thousand unspoken words, a silent conversation that lingers between curiosity and understanding. Working in pornography can be a liberating experience. Love is ephemeral and ethereal. A man must confront death and die a zillion times before he is bestowed with immortality and attains nirvana. Feed the absurdities into Artificial Intelligence models, and everything crashes. Pushing Boundaries with Artificial Intelligence. The Core of Artificial Intelligence is nothing but Regurgitation. The True Test of Intelligence is in handling of the Absurd and the Obscure. A few mistakes must be committed by ourselves instead of wholly learning from the mistakes of the others. Mistakes: A Dichotomy of Life Transformation from the perspective of personal, community, social, collective, business etc. Every action and statement of ours has either a political or religious or sexual ramification. The Myth of Neutrality. Everyone has a WhatsApp Uncle, if you don’t have one, then they have one. Everyone has a crazy neighbour, if you don’t have one, then they have one. Everyone has an idiot batch-mate, if you don’t have one, then they have one. We all are prostitutes, some are mentally prostituting, some are emotionally prostituting, some are physically prostituting, some are commercially prostituting, and some needs to prostitute on combination, to satiate their lives. My whole life has been akin to an untethered kite dancing in a hurricane. Always fluttering, always struggling, and never settling. Every relationship is transactional. That’s the beauty or ugliness of it; whichever way you see it. The only traits a man need is to endure and survive, and that’s for leaders as well. My conundrum is about whether to work-out the path of the fate or to work-out the fate of the path. I feel safe, I feel scared, I feel ready, and yet unprepared. The cosmos has thrown a curveball at me, and I am planning to hit out of the spectrum. A country whose pathways viz. the footpaths, the pavements, the the village roads, the city roads, the highways, the express-ways, and the interstates are interlaced with garbage, potholes, blockades, barricades, processions, speed-breakers, and nubile-drivers can never be on the path to development, progress, future, and global-superpower. You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes? When a man confines himself to a room, the world has only three people “I, me, and myself.” Existence becomes a curse, survival a sentence, and mind a prison. Though, it can be a beauty in solitude, divine in distress, nirvana in reflections, and moksha in abyss. You ever wonder if the devil’s just a man who survived too long? Conjure up a deadbeat fallout style philosophical monologue (lengthy one) based on the song “Gangsta’s Paradise” by Coolio. Every night I ponder over my fate, was I destined to be here, “an obscure existence in an obscure hamlet.” Every night I ponder over my fate—was I destined to be here? An obscure existence, in an obscure hamlet, forgotten by time and untouched by mercy. The stars above don’t speak anymore… they just stare, cold and indifferent, as if they too have given up on the story of me. Every damn night I lie awake, chewing on the same thought—was this always gonna be it? Me. Stuck in this rotting patch of nowhere. Some forgotten speck where even the wind sounds bored. No glory. No purpose. Just silence thick enough to choke on and memories that hit like shrapnel. Someone on the edge and perhaps a ledge. Every night I crawl back into my head, and it asks the same question—is this it? Was I born just to rot in this piss-stained corner of the world? Some godforsaken hamlet no one maps, where even the crows look lost. I talk to shadows now. At least they listen. The wind keeps whispering things I’m starting to believe. And the ledge… the ledge don’t judge. It just waits. In a world where everyone is clamouring to be the lion, the tiger, the eagle, the falcon, the wolf—symbols of dominance, aggression, grandeur, and control—where does the Kabootar fit in? The Kabootar Manifesto; The Kabootar Philosophy; The Kabootar Ideology The Old Man, the Dog, and the Stick Parable. In a nation stifled by the language row, silence didn’t remain golden—it turned militant. Where tongues were once celebrated, now silence is enforced. And they call it unity. With the language row stifling India, apparently, “silence is golden” become vehement. Burn the play-book and bring back the profanities in our conversation, especially the business conversations. In an era of global dominance and warfare, India must dump the fucking play-book of the international relations to achieve her vision of being a global superpower. Life is nothing but a relentless pursuit of endurance and survival, while carving out a path for yourself.

The capitalist machine grinds on, churning out profit for the privileged few while leaving the vast majority to toil for scraps. We are the bakers with empty cupboards, the builders sleeping in the streets, the minds overflowing with potential chained to dead-end jobs.\nThe Lies We’ve Been Sold\nThey tell us competition breeds innovation, but all it breeds is inequality. The rich hoard resources, leaving others to fight over crumbs. They preach meritocracy, while the children of privilege inherit wealth and opportunity. They claim democracy serves the people, yet our voices are drowned out by the clinking of coins in the pockets of the powerful.\nA World Transformed\nWe envision a world reborn, a world where:\nThe means of production - factories, farms, resources - are owned and controlled democratically by the people, not by a select elite. Labor is valued, not just for its profit potential, but for its contribution to society. Everyone who works deserves a fair share of the wealth they help create. Basic needs are met - food, shelter, healthcare, education - as fundamental rights, not privileges reserved for the lucky few. Power resides with the people through genuine participatory democracy, where every voice is heard and every vote counts. The Road to Revolution\nThis transformation won’t be granted by those who benefit from the current system. It will require a revolution, a collective uprising of the oppressed. We must:\nOrganize - workers, students, farmers, the marginalized - into a united front. Solidarity is our strength. Educate ourselves and others about the exploitative nature of capitalism and the possibilities of a socialist future. Take action - through strikes, protests, and civil disobedience, we will make our voices heard and disrupt the status quo. Embrace diversity - our revolution must encompass all forms of oppression, dismantling racism, sexism, and other hierarchies alongside capitalism. The Choice is Ours\nThe path ahead will not be easy. There will be challenges, setbacks, and sacrifices. But the alternative - a life of perpetual subservience - is far worse. We have the power to create a better future, a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\nJoin us, comrades! Let the flames of revolution ignite! Let us build a world where freedom, equality, and solidarity are not mere slogans, but the very foundation of our society!\nA luta continua (The struggle continues!)",

As a responsible citizen of India, like yourself, I am of the strong view that the onus of resurrecting the Indian Democracy lies on every citizen, including me. In this time of critical juncture in India’s past, present and future, it’s high time we come together and formulate a formidable strategy, and put it in action. Who am I? What I stand for? What I aspire for? What I can contribute? What we shall do? Strategy - Vision and Objectives - Campaign(s) - Initiatives - Plan - Execution Action Plan Roles and Responsibilities Media Enrollment",
